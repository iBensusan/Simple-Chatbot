# Simple Python Chatbot

A basic Python chatbot that can respond to a limited set of questions or keywords. This chatbot analyzes user input and gives predefined responses based on keywords it detects. It’s an excellent project for practicing control flow, dictionaries, and user input handling in Python.

## Features

- **Keyword-Based Responses**: Uses a dictionary to map user input keywords to predefined responses.
- **User-Friendly Interaction**: Continuously chats with the user until they decide to exit by typing "bye."
- **Real-Time Information**: Provides the current time and day using Python’s `datetime` module.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
